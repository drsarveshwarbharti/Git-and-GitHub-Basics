### Introduction to Git and GitHub

***Git*** is a powerful distributed version control system created by Linus Torvalds in 2005. 
It allows developers to track changes in their codebase, collaborate efficiently, and maintain a complete history of project development. 
Unlike centralized systems, Git provides each developer with a full copy of the repository, enabling offline work, branching, merging, 
and experimentation without affecting the main project until changes are ready to be shared.

***GitHub*** is a cloud-based platform that builds on top of Git, offering a collaborative environment for hosting repositories. 
It provides tools such as pull requests, issues, discussions, and project boards that make teamwork and project management seamless. 
Beyond code storage, GitHub has become a global hub for open-source projects, professional collaboration, and continuous integration with modern development pipelines.

Together, Git and GitHub streamline the software development lifecycle. 
Git ensures reliability, version control, and experimentation at the developerâ€™s machine, while GitHub provides connectivity, visibility, and collaboration for teams worldwide. 
Mastering these tools not only improves coding practices but also helps developers build strong portfolios, contribute to open source, and work effectively in industry environments.
